<h2>Developmental Seminars</h2>
  <h3>About Developmental Seminars</h3>
    <p>Developmental seminars provide an opportunity for PhD Students to present their work in a supportive environment and obtain feedback from their colleagues.
      These works may range from working papers, proposals in the idea-stage, and first-year research plans.
    </p>

  <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p>We welcome submissions from any doctoral researcher in business or management-related topic interested in obtaining the feedback of their peers</p>

  <h3>Session Format</h3>
    <p>Sessions will last an hour, with presenters having 15 - 30 minutes to present their topic, followed by group discussion. The content of each presentation is free to vary according to need, but should
    at a minimum contain the objectives of the work and a proposed methodology.</p>
    <p>If as a presenter you would like to use slides, please indicate so beforehand so we can have the necessary equipment available. However, slides are by no means required.</p>
  <h3>Submission Requirements</h3>
    <p>Abstracts should contain at least 100 words and should be submitted in English or Spanish so that they can be accessible to all potential reviewers.</p>
    <p>Submissions should include, at a minimum, a description of the research problem, the objectives of the project, and a proposed methodology. If you have more, you can submit as much as an extended abstract: around 2000 words. If you would like to submit more, please contact the editor for the particular session before submitting as too many long submissions could strain the capacity of our reviewers.</p>
    <p>If the abstract represents a work that is being developed for a specific conference, assignment, or journal, please indicate so along with the submitted document and include
      the deadline for the assignment.</p>
  <h3>Selection Criteria</h3>
    <p>Since the objective of the developmental seminar is to provide a space to obtain constructive feedback, submissions will be evaluated based primarily on need. Upcoming conference submissions and call for
        papers will be given priority.</p>
    <p>Have doubts about whether your paper is "worthy" of presentation? If it meets the minimum requirements, submit!</p>
  <h3>Submission Procedure</h3>
    <p>Developmental Seminars are held regularly. Those interested in presenting in a developmental seminar should see the Event Calendar (LINK ME!) on this site for specific submission instructions.
      Editors are volunteers and participate as such on a rotating basis, so be sure to send your abstract to the editor that corresponds to the seminar in which you would like to submit.</p>
    <p>A deadline for submission will be specified for each event, which will be approximately two weeks prior to scheduled presentation and will also be available on the event details.</p>
    <p>The review process will mirror those of actual conferences. Upon receiving a submission, the editor may send the abstract out to two reviewers, who will comment on its content and
      recommend that it be rejected or accepted.</p>
    <p>Participants will be notified approximately one week prior to presentation if their abstract has been accepted for presentation. All accepted abstracts will be distributed to all members of the association
    unless the author requests otherwise.</p>
  <h3>Benefits of Submission</h3>
    <p>All submitted abstracts will receive feedback which can be used in the development of your work.</p>
    <p>Interested in participating as a guest editor? Guest editing provides a wonderful opportunity to learn about the work of your colleagues, as well as a unique experience in the coordination of
        the submission process. Guest editors should have some experience with the process (multiple rejections included) and be able to dedicate several hours in the weeks prior to the presentation.
        Send an email to ryarmsta7@alumnes.ub.edu if you would like to be considered for a particular session.</p>
