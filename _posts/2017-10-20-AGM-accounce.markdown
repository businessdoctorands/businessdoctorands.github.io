  <ul>
    <li>Organization of development seminars (>=1 per semester)</li>
    <li>Writing groups (1 active groups + available resources)</li>
    <li>Maintenance of the webpage (up to date monthly)</li>
    <li>Communication and visibility (2 very short blog posts per month)</li>
    <li>Monthly newsletter (newsletter sent monthly)</li>
    <li>Recruitment / Outreach (new member count)</li>
    <li>Organization of workshops (1 workshop or seminar per semester)</li>
    <li>Funding (a determinar)</li>
  </ul>

Not every post needs to be determined at the meeting.

  <li>Any other business</li>
</ol>

We look forward to seeing you there!
