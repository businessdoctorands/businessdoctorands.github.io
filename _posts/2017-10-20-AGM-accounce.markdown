•	Organization of development seminars (>=1 per semester)
•	Writing groups (1 active groups + available resources)
•	Maintenance of the webpage (up to date monthly)
•	Communication and visibility (2 very short blog posts per month)
•	Monthly newsletter (newsletter sent monthly)
•	Recruitment / Outreach (new member count)
•	Organization of workshops (1 workshop or seminar per semester)
•	Funding (a determinar)
Not every post needs to be determined at the meeting.
7.	Any other business
