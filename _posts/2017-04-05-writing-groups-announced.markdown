After a long winter, the spring has come, and so have writing groups! Our own Alina Fesenko has organized the first writing group of 2017 to take place on April 18, 2017 at 12:00 pm at the UB.

Why writing groups?
-------------------

Since the dawn of time, small groups of researchers have joined together to support one another in increasing their scientific output. Below is a list of common problems encountered by doctoral researchers (and seasoned PhDs).

  - Missed objectives
  - Lack of creativity
  - Low productivity
  - Threats of physicial violence from supervisor

Writing groups address these by facilitating the creation of [SMART goals](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/smart-goals.php), generating accountability, and providing a space to mutually overcome the barriers that inevitably arise in the practice of academic writing.

Session format 
--------------

If you have never heard of a writing group, check out the [UNC Writing Center](http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/writing-groups/writing-group-starter-kit/) website for an overview of the types of activities involved. Ultimately, what the writing group is like will depend on who is organizing it!

For these first sessions, we will stick to the basics: Writing groups are meant to be lean, so this first group will have a maximum of 5 people. Consistency is the key, there will be mechanisms to encourage participation---more carrot than stick.

How to participate
------------------ 

[Contact us!](/contact) Or come knock on the PhD office door and let us know you're interested.

Once the first spots are filled, we can also help you set up your own writing group, and provide space to do so.

Happy writing!
