We had many new faces, both new PhD students as well as first-time participants in the group. A big welcome to all of you!

## Summary of 2017 Activities

We covered our major activities of 2017, which fell into the categories of social events, developmental seminars, and writing groups. 

### Development seminars
Cristián, Alfonso, Nina and Ryan presented their researches in progress and got valuable feedback from their colleagues!
“Your colleagues are not afraid of being harsh!” - Nina
### Workshops
Lucho Dominguez, director of Design Research of Telefónica, imparted a workshop of Design Thinking in October, and the results were presented in a conference in the Mobile World Center.
### Writing groups

_Writing is 1% inspiration, 99% <s>perspiration</s> procrastination._
From April to July of 2017, 12 sessions have been organized, during which 22 tasks were carried out (66% on time, 34% rescheduled). 

## Proposals for Activities for 2018

2018 promises to be an exciting year for AIEF. Generally,  we will continue in the direction of 2017, aiming first to support activities for PhDs at the UB and promote participation, but with an eye for including researchers from other universities in the area. The main activities will continue to be the organization of social events, development seminars, writing groups, and workshops, which are meant to support the well-being and development of early career researchers in business, management, and organization.

The first order of business were nominations  of volunteer posts.
Some volunteers offered to help with the organization of the activities and communication of the association. 
In the meeting, several people graciously volunteered to help out, some on an _ad hoc_ basis and others on a more permanent one.
Below are highlights of continued activities:

#### Development seminars

Nina was nominated as editor. The editor encourages participation, nominates reviewers and organizes at least one seminar per semester. 

#### Workshops
#### Writing groups
Alina will continue as our capable organizer of writing groups.
#### Social events
#### Seeking funding for group activities
Esther has expressed interest in helping us find funding, a key topic for the development of the association.
#### Maintenance of the webpage
Gema will take care of the webpage and Vahid will offer technical support and gather resources.
#### Communication

It was decided to build a communication team to promote our activities. Cristian was nominated to lead the transition with the support of many others. Everyone can help out with communications - specific steps are included with this month's newsletter with plans to include an instructions page on the web.
The task of sending monthly newsletter has been integrated into this team.

####	Recruitment

For the moment, we have decided to limit recruitment to informal activities while we establish our organizational structure and functioning. 

## Upcoming events
Several upcoming events were discussed to be included in the monthly newsletter. Of these, participation was encouraged for writing groups.

So concluded the meeting. Thank you to all who attended!
