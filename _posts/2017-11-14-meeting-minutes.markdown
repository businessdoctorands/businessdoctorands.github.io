We had many new faces, both new PhD students as well as first-time participants in the group. A big welcome to all of you!

## Summary of 2017 Activities

We covered our major activities of 2017, which fell into the categories of social events, developmental seminars, and writing groups. 

### Development seminars
Cristián, Alfonso, Nina and Ryan presented their researches in progress and got valuable feedback from their colleagues!
“Your colleagues are not afraid of being harsh!” by Nina
### Workshops
Lucho Dominguez, director of Design Research of Telefónica, imparted a workshop of Design Thinking in October, and the results were presented in a conference in the Mobile World Center.
### Writing groups 
Writing groups were redubbed Kill Procrastination groups.
_Writing is 1% inspiration, 99% <s>perspiration</s> procrastination._
From April to July of 2017, 12 sessions have been organized, during which 22 tasks were carried out (66% on time, 34% rescheduled). 

## Proposals for Activities for 2018
Nominations  of volunteer posts
Some volunteers offered to help with the organization of the activities and communication of the association. 
In the meeting, several people graciously volunteered to help out, some on an _ad hoc_ basis and others on a more permanent one.
Below are highlights of continued activities:

We will build a communication team in charge of content marketing. Official accounts of Twitter, Facebook and Google + will be created. Cristián was nominated for team leader and Nina will work with him. We call for more volunteers to form part of it!
The task of sending monthly newsletter has been integrated into this team.
It was emphasized that everyone can help with communication, and so instructions on how to do that will be forthcoming on the webpage.

####	Recruitment

For the moment, we have decided to limit recruitment to informal activities while we establish our organizational structure and functioning. 

## Upcoming events
Several upcoming events were discussed to be included in the monthly newsletter. Of these, participation was encouraged for writing groups.

So concluded the meeting. Thank you to all who attended!
