Academic Associations
---------------------

Academic associations are the backbone of management research. These research communities are an excellent opportunity to get to know one's peers and can also help guide your studies. Each holds an annual conference, as well as regular workshops throughout Europe and the rest of the world. Apart from community, there is no better way road to publication---the editors attending these will be happy to tell you exactly what they look for!

Most have benefits for being a member and sometimes this is free.
