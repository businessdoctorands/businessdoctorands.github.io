This is a space for resources for PhD Students in Business. Right now, it is sadly empty! If you would like to add some, you can do so directly by editing this file in our [github respository](http://github.com/businessdoctorands), or contact us indicating the resource. A video of how to contribute to public webpages can be found [here](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/master/contributing.md).
